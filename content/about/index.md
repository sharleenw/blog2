I am a Data Analyst currently working in the public sector in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In 2015, I graduated with an M.Sc. in Statistics from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

In 2011, I graduated from McMaster University's Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering program.

When not programming, I like to go birding, snowboarding, cycling, running, sailing, or practice my handstands and aerial arts.
