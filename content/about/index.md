I am a Data Scientist living in British Columbia who uses R, R Markdown, git, LaTeX, SQL, and Shiny to create data analyses and reports.

In 2015, I graduated with an M.Sc. in Statistics from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.

In 2011, I graduated from McMaster University's Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering program.

When not programming, I like to go birding, hiking, cycling, or sailing.
