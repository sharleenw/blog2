# Introduction

A member of the Hamilton Naturalist Club mentioned the idea of creating a `gganimate` plot, so I thought I'd try it! I mostly modified the code from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other) StackOverflow page.

There's some jumping around, and I think a way to prevent that might be to interpolate values between each year so that, say, Lesser Scaup doesn't go from not-on-the-chart in one year to 2002 individuals seen in the next year.

# Data visualizing using a gganimate plot

Here is the final plot:

And here is the code that I used to create it!


```{r gganimate-plot, code = readLines(here("content", "post", "2019-05-26-hamilton-cbc-part-4", "gganimate.R")), message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

```

And thank you to the Christmas Bird Count! The Christmas Bird Count Data was provided by [National Audubon Society](www.christmasbirdcount.org) and through the generous efforts of [Bird Studies Canada](www.bsc-eoc.org) and countless volunteers across the western hemisphere.

# Session info

```{r reproducibility, echo = FALSE}

devtools::session_info()

```
